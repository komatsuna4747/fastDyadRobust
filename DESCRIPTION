Description: The fastDyadRobust package computes cluster-robust standard errors for dyadic data as suggested by Aronow, Samii, and Assenova (2015). This package is built on dyadRobust, which also calculates dyadic-robust standard errors. With the aid of RcppArmadillo and RcppParallel, fastDyadRobust performs dyadic-robust standard error computation much faster than dyadRobust.
