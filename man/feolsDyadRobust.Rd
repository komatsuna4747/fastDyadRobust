\usage{
feolsDyadRobust(fml, data, cluster, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{fml}{A formula representing the relation to be estimated. For example: \code{fml = z~x+y}. To include fixed-effects, insert them in this formula using a pipe: e.g. \code{fml = z~x+y | fe_1+fe_2}. You can combine two fixed-effects with \code{^}: e.g. \code{fml = z~x+y|fe_1^fe_2}, see details. You can also use variables with varying slopes using square brackets: e.g. in \code{fml = z~y|fe_1[x] + fe_2}, see details. To add IVs, insert the endogenous vars./instruments after a pipe, like in \code{y ~ x | c(x_endo1, x_endo2) ~ x_inst1 + x_inst2}. Note that it should always be the last element, see details. Multiple estimations can be performed at once: for multiple dep. vars, wrap them in \code{c()}: ex \code{c(y1, y2)}. For multiple indep. vars, use the stepwise functions: ex \code{x1 + csw(x2, x3)}. The formula \code{fml = c(y1, y2) ~ x1 + cw0(x2, x3)} leads to 6 estimation, see details. Square brackets starting with a dot can be used to call global variables: \code{y.[i] ~ x.[1:2]} will lead to \code{y3 ~ x1 + x2} if \code{i} is equal to 3 in the current environment (see details in \code{\link[fixest]{xpd}}).}

\item{data}{A data.frame containing the necessary variables to run the model. The variables of the non-linear right hand side of the formula are identified with this \code{data.frame} names. Can also be a matrix.}

\item{cluster}{hoge
Tells how to dyadically cluster the standard-errors.
Assume we want to perform dyadic clustering over var1 and var2 contained in the data.frame.
Then you should provide \code{feolsDyadRobust()} with \code{cluster = c("var1", "var2")}.}

\item{...}{Other parameters to be passed to \code{fixest::feols()}.}
}
\value{
Returns a \code{fixest} object whose standard errors are computed by \code{vcovDyadRobust()}.
}
\description{
A wrapper function for \code{fixest::feols()} to compute dyadic-robust standard errors.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Load a toy dataset
df <- fastDyadRobust::toyData

# Run regression using fastDyadRobust::feolsDyadRobust()
# You can pass other arguments to fixest::feols() such as `weidhts`.
reg <-
  fastDyadRobust::feolsDyadRobust(
    fml = dy ~ dx1 + dx2,
    data = df,
    cluster = c("src", "dst")
